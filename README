INSTALLATION

* Make sure you have a PHP & MySQL enabled apache server with mod_rewrite.
* Get the software from it's git repository at http://code.burningsoda.com/liki/
  by issuing: git clone http://code.burningsoda.com/liki <MY-LIKI-DIR>
* Adjust the database settings in config.php
* If the directory where you install the software on your webserver is not
  /liki you need to tinker with the supplied .htaccess file, too.
* Make sure pix/ (or whatever your dataDir is called---see config.php)
  is writable by your web server. (ie. chmod a+rwx pix)
* Run:
  php -r 'require("bsLikiBackend.class.php");$b=new bsLikiBackend();$b->createTables();'
  to setup the tables in your database.
* ...and Play!

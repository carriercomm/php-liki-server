INSTALLATION

* Make sure you have a PHP & MySQL enabled apache server with mod_rewrite.
* Get the software from it's darcs-repository at http://devel.burningsoda.com/darcs/liki/
* Adjust the database settings in config.php
* If the directory where you install the software on your webserver is not
  /liki you need to tinker with the supplied .htaccess file, too.
* Make sure pix/ (or whatever your dataDir is called---see config.php)
  is writable by your web server. (ie. chmod a+rwx pix)
* The table specified in config.php will be created on first startup.
* ...and Play!
